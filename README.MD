Overview
--------
Lybrary for drawing L-Systems onto various drawing surfaces. Each step of an L-System is
generated recursively to a given depth then drawn onto the surface. A handler base class
can be implemented for drawing on different surfaces. This baseclass also keeps track of
the coordinates and the angles for the L-System factory class.
